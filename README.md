We want to do a lot of things. But we don't want to lift a finger. So we came
up with this bot. Now we can go back to sleeping and living slow.

========

* A messy implementation of a currency converter because whatever.
* A wheel of misfortune.
* An URL utility thing for sharing links like a sir.

Requirements
========
So far:

* [Cinch](https://github.com/cinchrb/cinch)
* [Free Currency Converter API](http://freecurrencyconverterapi.com)
