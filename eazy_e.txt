stop him in his tracks, show him that i am ruthless
time to pay the piper
this is the season to let the real motherfuckin gs in
boy you should've known by now
approach me like you hard, motherfucker i'm gonna bank you
i never met an og who never did shit wrong
claiming my city, but dre, you ain't from compton
this is going out to your studio gangsters
never ever once have you ran with the turf
smoother then a bitch but portray the role of gangster
